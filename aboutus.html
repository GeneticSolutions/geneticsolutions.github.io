        <h2>I want my DNA report, what should I do?</h2>

        <a>To get your Ancestry report, you must have a pre-existing DNA test (preferably through AncestryDNA, 23AndMe, or MyHeritage). From there, simply download your raw DNA file and send it to us via our Ko-Fi page. Please be sure to follow the instructions provided.</a>

        <h2>How long does it take to deliver results?</h2>

        <a>Usually between 1-3 business days.</a> 
        
        <h2>What will my results look like?</h2>

        <a>Once completed, your full package will be in the form of a PDF format. It will include everything described in the package description, such as Neolithic Ancestry Breakdown, Y-DNA Haplogroup Prediction, and Phenotype Prediction.</a>

        <h2>What technology do you use to determine the results?</h2>

        <a>We leverage Harvard Universityâ€™s AdmixTools software, which was developed by ReichLabs for the sole purpose of determining population admixture. This is practically the GOLD STANDARD for ancient ancestry breakdowns.</a>
